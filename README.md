# cqExperiments
Project implements a black box CQ solver, suitable for both linear and nonlinear problems. Main application are scattering problems by making use of the BEM - Library Bempp. The toolbox is capable of solving a general class of evolution equations, possibly nonlocal in time and space under the assumption of vanishing initial conditions.
