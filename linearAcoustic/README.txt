This is a short guide on how to recreate the pictures from the Preprint 

"Time-dependent acoustic scattering from generalized impedance boundary conditions via boundary elements and convolution quadrature",

submitted in MayCr of 2020 by Lehel Banjai, Christian Lubich and JÃ¶rg Nick. 


To recreate the error plots, run the following codes in the following order:

1. Create_error_data.py (Runtime ca. 12 hours on my machine.)
2. Create_error_plots.m


To recreate the frames, run the following codes in the following order:

1. Create_image_data.py (Runtime ca. 12 hours on my machine.)
2. Create_images.m


The Python-codes need Bempp to be installed, I used the Bempp version 3.3.4. The Python used by me is version
2.7.12.
The Matlab version used by me is 2017a.
